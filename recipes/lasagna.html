    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layered flat pasta, meat or vegetables, cheese, and a tomato-based sauce. The pasta sheets are alternated with fillings, creating a layered casserole that is baked in the oven. The most common filling for lasagna is a meat-based sauce made with beef, pork, or a combination of both, mixed with a tomato-based sauce and spices. The dish is topped with mozzarella, parmesan, or other grated cheese that melts and forms a golden crust during baking. Some variations of lasagna also include ricotta cheese as a filling, adding creaminess to the dish.</p>
    <p>Lasagna is traditionally served in square portions, with a hearty sauce and tender noodles that are both filling and flavorful. It is often served with a green salad or garlic bread and is a popular comfort food for many families and a staple dish at celebrations and events.</p>
