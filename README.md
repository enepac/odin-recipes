HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure and present content on the World Wide Web. HTML tags are used to define elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

Each HTML tag has a specific meaning and purpose, and helps to create the structure and content of a web page. For example, the \<h1> tag is used to define a main heading, while the \<p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text.

Tags are typically written in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag includes a forward slash (/) to indicate that it's the end of that specific element. For example, a heading might be written as: \<h1>This is a heading \</h1>.

It's important to use the correct HTML tags, as well as to properly nest them (i.e., put one tag inside another when necessary), in order to ensure that a web page is properly structured and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

By learning the basics of HTML tags, you'll be able to create simple, well-structured web pages that can be viewed by anyone with a web browser.
